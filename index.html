				<h2>Why Recreactiv' ?</h2>
				<p>
					Since 2019, I gave been giving scolar support for students in need. I really enjoyed seeing them progressing and bring home better grades. This is how the idea of creating a website to get in touch students and tutors came out. Recreactiv' is a mix between fun and learning, as the lessons are given from students to students. 
				</p>

				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p> 
					Tutors wanting to share their knowledge with students in difficulty offer their time (minimum 1 hour per week) to help them. Students can discuss on the dedicated platform and meet in a safe place, among those offered on the application (libraries, cafes, dedicated rooms, etc.). According to where you live, you can choose a place and a teacher below !
